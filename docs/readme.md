[![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

A Common Lisp kernel for Jupyter along with a library for building Jupyter
kernels, based on [Maxima-Jupyter][] by Robert Dodier which was based on
[cl-jupyter][] by Frederic Peschanski.

Installation instructions can be found in the `docs` directory or at 
[install][].
